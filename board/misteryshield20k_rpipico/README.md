# MiSTeryShield20k RPiPico USB board

Features:

* Headers to plug the Tang Nano 20K
* Headers to plug the [Raspberry Pi Pico (W)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico)
* Atari / Commodore style joystick interface
  * Supports up to two buttons
  * Including 5V supply and 5V level shifters
  * Works with DB9 joystcks and mice
  * MIDI
    * MIDI OUT with driver chip to protect Tang Nano 20K
    * MIDI IN with optocoupler to protect Tang Nano 20K
* 4 x USB-A Interface
* Spare header for FPGA IO / [Dualshock 2 Adapter cable](/board/misteryshield20k_ds2_adapter/misteryshield20k_ds2_adapter_cable.md) (**no DS2 connector onboard**)
* Debug header for Pico UART and e.g. FPGA UART
* 3 x PiPico Status LED
* 3D STEP model to ease case development
* [CERN-OHL-S](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home) license

PCBA production files for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) are availble [here](Output/production)  
(Fully assembled boards can orderd based on BOM partlist, excluding the TN20k and PiPico connector)  

The great PCB Layout work using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org) had been done by [cantclosevi](https://github.com/cantclosevi). Thx Michal !
