This project relies on a MPU being connected to the FPGA. --> [MiSTle-Dev wiki](https://github.com/MiSTle-Dev/.github/wiki) <--  

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't need the WIFI modem on a TN20K then even the onboard BL616 MPU (normally used for bitstream programming) can be used. A dedicated FPGA bitstream and FPGA companion firmware is needed in that configuration. The onboard BL616 MPU is presently supported for Nano 20k, Console 60k / 138k, Primer 25k, Mega 138k Pro and Mega 60k Dock. WIFI modem is supported on Console 60K / 138k and Mega 60k Dock too (requires I-PEX MHF4 connector antenna)

## emulated Diskdrive c1541

Emulated 1541 on a regular FAT/exFAT formatted microSD card including parallel bus Speedloader Dolphin DOS 2.0.
Copy a D64 Disk image to your sdcard and rename it to **disk8.d64** as default boot image.
Add further D64 or G64 images as you like and insert card in TN slot. LED 0 acts as Drive activity indicator.

> [!TIP]
> Disk directory listing: [(or F7 keypress)](https://project64.c64.org/hw/dolphindos.txt)  
> command:  
> LOAD"$",8  
> LIST  
> Load first program from Disk: (or just LOAD if Dolphin Kernal active)  
> LOAD"*",8  
> RUN  

c1541 DOS ROM can be selected from OSD (default Dolphin DOS 2.0, CBM DOS, SpeedDos Plus or JiffyDOS)
In case a program don't load correctly select via OSD the factory default CBM DOS an give it a try.

## Cartridge ROM Loader (.CRT)

Cartridge ROM can be loaded via OSD file selection.
Copy a *.CRT to your sdcard and rename it to **c64crt.crt** as default boot cartridge ROM.
Prevent the cartridge load at boot by OSD CRT selection **No Disk** , **Save settings** and System **Cold Boot**.
> [!TIP]
> **Detach Cartridge** by OSD:
> ```temporary``` **Cartridge unload & Reset** ```permanent``` **No Disk**, **Save settings** and System **Cold Boot**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be aware that some Freezer Card CRT might require to use the standard C64 Kernal and the standard C1541 CBM DOS.

## BASIC Program Loader (.PRG)

A BASIC Program *.PRG file can be loaded via OSD file selection.
Copy a .PRG to your sdcard and rename it to **c64prg.prg** as default boot basic program. Prevent the PRG load at boot by OSD PRG selection **No Disk** , **Save settings** and **Reset** or System **Cold Boot**.
> [!TIP]
> Check loaded file by command: **LIST**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> command: **RUN**

## Tape Image Loader (*.TAP)

A [Tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette) *.TAP file can be loaded via OSD file selection
In order to start a tape download choose C64 CBM Kernal (mandatory as Dolphin DOS doesn't support Tape). Best to save Kernal OSD selection via **Save settings**.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> command: **LOAD**  
> ___ Only if you have [Exbasic Level II](https://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php?title=Exbasic_Level_II&oldid=261004). CRT Basic loaded then use command: 
> **LOAD***  
> Screen will blank!

The file is loaded automatically as soon as TAP file selected via OSD (no need to press PLAY TAPE button) in case ***no** TAP had been previously selected*.
As mentioned screen will blank for several seconds and then display briefly the filename of the to be loaded file. It will blank shortly afterwards again till load completed and take a lot of time...
Copy a *.TAP to your sdcard and rename it to **c64tap.tap** as default tape mountpoint.
For **Tape unload** use OSD TAP selection **No Disk** and **Reset** or System **Cold Boot**
> [!WARNING]
> After board power-up or coldboot a TAP file will **not autoloaded** even if TAP file selection had been saved or c64tap.tap mountpoint available !
> Unblock loader by OSD TAP selection **No Disk** or simply select again the desired TAP file to be loaded after you typed **LOAD**

> [!TIP]
> Check loaded file by command: **LIST**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> command: **RUN**

> [!NOTE]
> The available (muffled) Tape Sound audio can be disabled from OSD.

## Kernal Loader (.BIN)

The build-in Dolphin Kernal is the power-up default C64 Kernal with an excellent C1541 speedloader.
> [!TIP]
> If you are fine with that then there is no need to load another Kernal via OSD and just select OSD Kernal BIN selection **No Disk** and **Save settings**!

In general Kernal ROM files *.BIN can be loaded via OSD selection.
Copy a 8K C64 Kernal ROM .BIN to your sdcard and rename it to **c64kernal.bin** as default boot Kernal.
Prevent Kernal load by OSD Kernal BIN selection **No Disk** and **Save settings** and do a **power-cyle** of the board. In this case the build-in Dolphin Kernal will by default be used after next power cycle.

## SID Filter Curve (.FLT)

Custom Filters curves can optionally be loaded via OSD.
> [!TIP]https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/software/image-bbs/
> This is in most cases not needed and build-in filters curves are already an optimum.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to select the 6581 chip, not the 8580.
> Select 'Custom 1' as the filter to activate it. When a custom filter is loaded, there's no difference between custom options Custom 1, 2, and 3. Selecting 'Default' switches back to the built-in filter curve.
https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/software/image-bbs/
Prevent Filter curve load by OSD Kernal **FLT** selection **No Disk** and **Save settings** and **power-cyle** of the board.

## Core Loader Sequencing

The core will after power cycle/ cold-boot start downloading the images on the sdcard in the following order:

> [!NOTE]
> (1) BIN Kernal, (2) CRT ROM, (3) PRG Basic and finally (4) FLT.

## emulated RAM Expansion Unit REU 1750

For those programs the require a [RAM Expansion Unit (REU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_REU) it can be activated by OSD on demand.

Playing [Sonic the Hedgehog V1.2](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=212523)
Enable REU, and load the PRG.  
Playing around with [GEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system))
Enable REU, select c1541 CBM DOS ROM and load the PRG.

## Push Button / DIP Switch utilization

* S1 open OSD **and** Swap the Joystick Ports if OSD **Swap Joys** is set to Off mode.  
(you might to press twice to return to original Joystick port setting)

* S2 Reset

> [!CAUTION]
> A FLASH programm attempt without keeping the board in reset may lead to corruption of the C1541 DOS images stored in FLASH requiring re-programming.
> Nano 20k S2 keep pressed during power-up for FLASH programming of FPGA bitstream

## MIDI-IN and OUT

<s>Type of MIDI interface can be selected from OSD. There is support for Sequential Inc., Passport/Sentech, DATEL/SIEL/JMS/C-LAB and Namesoft. You can use a [MiSTeryNano shield](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/tree/main/board/misteryshield20k/README.md) to interface to a Keyboard.</s>

## RS232 Serial Interface Swiftlink-232 <-> WIFI Modem

Have a look: [Wiki WIFI Modem](https://github.com/harbaum/FPGA-Companion/wiki/AT-Wi%E2%80%90Fi-modem)  

Most Terminal programs need the Kernal serial routines therefore select via OSD the CBM Kernal rather than default DolphinDOS.  
In addition select OSD System RS232 mode ``Swiftlink DE``. Also possible ACIA [6551](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6551) addresses are: $DE00 (default), $DF00 or $D700.  

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to active the ``PETSCII`` character input mode if you are sending commands to the modem !

For a PETSCII or ASCII/ANSI BBS you can use [ccgms](https://github.com/mist64/ccgmsterm).  
Press ``F8`` and select modem ``Swiftlink DE`` and Baudrate of ``38400``.  
You can press ``Shift F8`` to toggle in between the different character [modes](https://github.com/mist64/ccgmsterm/blob/main/Documentation.md).  
Connect to you WIFI AP and have a try: ``ATD`` [bbs.retrocampus.com:6510](https://bbs.retrocampus.com) or just have a look at [telnetbbsguide](https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/software/image-bbs) and choose as you like.  

For a more exotic Turbo56k protocol BBS use [retroterm](https://github.com/retrocomputacion/retroterm).  

Note: Enabling persitent the Swiftlink-232 ACIA 6551 component at $FE00 will block other things like Multicard CRT ROMS. Adress $D700 doesn't block other HW.

## RS232 Serial Interface VIC-1011/UP9600 <-> USB-C / external HW pins

The Tang onboard USB-C serial port can be used for communication with the C64 Userport Serial port in [VIC-1011](http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/xother.html) or [UP9600](https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1656) mode. Terminal programs need the Kernal serial routines therefore select via OSD the CBM Kernal rather than default DolphinDOS. For a first start use UP9600 mode and a Terminal program like [ccgms](https://github.com/mist64/ccgmsterm) and on the PC side [Putty](https://www.putty.org) with 2400 Baud.

OSD selection allows to change in between TANG USB-C port or external HW pin interface.
