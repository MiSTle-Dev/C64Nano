# C64Nano
The C64Nano is a port of some [MiST](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki) and 
[MiSTer](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/) components of the
[C64 FPGA core ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) for the 
[Tang Nano 20k FPGA board](https://wiki.sipeed.com/nano20k) with a new VHDL top level and HDMI Video and Audio Output.<br>It has also been ported to the [Tang Primer 25K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-25k/primer-25k.html)  ([Gowin GW5A-25](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/product/detail/60/)) and [Tang Mega 138k Pro](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-mega-138k/mega-138k-pro.html) ([Gowin GW5AST-138](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/product/detail/60/)) too.<br>
Be aware that the [VIC20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC-20) had been ported too in similar manner ([VIC20Nano](https://github.com/vossstef/VIC20Nano)).<br>
Also the [Atari 2600 VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) had been ported ([A2600Nano](https://github.com/vossstef/A2600Nano)).<br>

HID interfaces aligned in pinmap and control to match [MiSTeryNano project's bl616 misterynano_fw](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/tree/main/firmware/misterynano_fw)
respectively [FPGA-Companion](https://github.com/harbaum/FPGA-Companion)<br>
Basically a µC acts as USB host for USB devices and as an OSD controller using a [SPI communication protocol](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/blob/main/SPI.md).<br>

**Note** PROJECT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
<br>
## Installation

The installation of C64 Nano on the Tang Nano 20k board can be done using a Linux PC or a Windows PC
[(Instruction)](INSTALLATION_WINDOWS.md).<br>

## c64 Nano on Tang Primer 25K
See [Tang Primer 25K](TANG_PRIMER_25K.md)

## c64 Nano on Tang Mega 138k Pro
See [Tang Mega 138K](TANG_MEGA_138K.md)

## emulated Diskdrive c1541
Emulated 1541 on a regular FAT/exFAT formatted microSD card including parallel bus Speedloader Dolphin DOS 2.0.<br>
Copy a D64 Disk image to your sdcard and rename it to **disk8.d64** as default boot image.<br>
Add further D64 or G64 images as you like and insert card in TN slot. LED 0 acts as Drive activity indicator.<br> 
> [!TIP]
Disk directory listing: [(or F7 keypress)](https://project64.c64.org/hw/dolphindos.txt)<br> 
command: <br>
LOAD"$",8<br>
LIST<br> 
Load first program from Disk: (or just LOAD if Dolphin Kernal active)<br> 
LOAD"*",8<br>
RUN<br>

c1541 DOS ROM can be selected from OSD (default Dolphin DOS 2.0, CBM DOS, SpeedDos Plus or JiffyDOS)<br>
In case a program don't load correctly select via OSD the factory default CBM DOS an give it a try.

## Cartridge ROM Loader (.CRT)
Cartridge ROM can be loaded via OSD file selection.<br>
Copy a *.CRT to your sdcard and rename it to **c64crt.crt** as default boot cartridge ROM.<br>
Prevent the cartridge load at boot by OSD CRT selection **No Disk** , **Save settings** and System **Cold Boot**.<br>
> [!TIP]
**Detach Cartridge** by OSD CRT selection **No Disk** and System **Cold Boot**.<br>

## BASIC Program Loader (.PRG)
A BASIC Program *.PRG file can be loaded via OSD file selection.<br>
Copy a *.PRG to your sdcard and rename it to **c64prg.prg** as default boot basic program. Prevent the PRG load at boot by OSD PRG selection **No Disk** , **Save settings** and **Reset** or System **Cold Boot**.<br>
> [!TIP]
Check loaded file by command: **LIST**<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
command: **RUN**<br>

## Tape Image Loader (*.TAP)
A [Tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette) *.TAP file can be loaded via OSD file selection<br>
In order to start a tape download choose C64 CBM Kernal (mandatory as Dolphin DOS doesn't support Tape). Best to save Kernal OSD selection via **Save settings**.<br>
> [!IMPORTANT]
command: **LOAD**<br>
___ Only if you have [Exbasic Level II](https://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php?title=Exbasic_Level_II&oldid=261004) .CRT Basic loaded then use command: **LOAD***<br>
Screen will blank!<br>

The file is loaded automatically as soon as TAP file selected via OSD (no need to press PLAY TAPE button) in case ***no** TAP had been previously selected*.<br>
As mentioned screen will blank for several seconds and then display briefly the filename of the to be loaded file. It will blank shortly afterwards again till load completed and take a lot of time...<br>
Copy a *.TAP to your sdcard and rename it to **c64tap.tap** as default tape mountpoint.<br>
For **Tape unload** use OSD TAP selection **No Disk** and **Reset** or System **Cold Boot**.<br>
> [!WARNING]
After board power-up or coldboot a TAP file will **not autoloaded** even if TAP file selection had been saved or c64tap.tap mountpoint available !<br>
Unblock loader by OSD TAP selection **No Disk** or simply select again the desired TAP file to be loaded after you typed **LOAD**<br>

> [!TIP]
Check loaded file by command: **LIST**<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
command: **RUN**<br>

> [!NOTE]
The available (muffled) Tape Sound audio can be disabled from OSD.<br>

## Kernal Loader (.BIN)
The build-in Dolphin Kernal is the power-up default C64 Kernal with an excellent C1541 speedloader.
> [!TIP]
If you are fine with that then there is no need to load another Kernal via OSD and just select OSD Kernal BIN selection **No Disk** and **Save settings**!<br>

In general Kernal ROM files *.BIN can be loaded via OSD selection.<br>
Copy a 8K C64 Kernal ROM *.BIN to your sdcard and rename it to **c64kernal.bin** as default boot Kernal.<br>
Prevent Kernal load by OSD Kernal BIN selection **No Disk** and **Save settings** and do a **power-cyle** of the board. In this case the build-in Dolphin Kernal will by default be used after next power cycle.<br>

## SID Filter Curve (.FLT)
Custom Filters curves can optionally be loaded via OSD. 
> [!TIP]
> This is in most cases not needed and build-in filters curves are already an optimum.

> [!NOTE]
Remember to select the 6581 chip, not the 8580.
Select 'Custom 1' as the filter to activate it.<br> When a custom filter is loaded, there's no difference between custom options Custom 1, 2, and 3. Selecting 'Default' switches back to the built-in filter curve.<br>

Prevent Filter curve load by OSD Kernal **FLT** selection **No Disk** and **Save settings** and **power-cyle** of the board.<br>

## Core Loader Sequencing
The core will after power cycle/ cold-boot start downloading the images on the sdcard in the following order:
> [!NOTE] 
(1) BIN Kernal, (2) CRT ROM, (3) PRG Basic and finally (4) FLT.<br>

## emulated RAM Expansion Unit REU 1750
For those programs the require a [RAM Expansion Unit (REU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_REU) it can be activated by OSD on demand.<br>
<br>
Playing [Sonic the Hedgehog V1.2](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=212523)<br>
Enable REU, and load the PRG.<br>
Playing around with [GEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system))<br>
Enable REU, select c1541 CBM DOS ROM and load the PRG.<br>

## Push Button utilization
* S2 keep pressed during power-up for FLASH programming of FPGA bitstream<br>
> [!CAUTION]
A FLASH programm attempt without keeping the board in reset may lead to corruption of the C1541 DOS images stored in FLASH requiring re-programming.
* S1 swap the Joystick Ports if OSD **Swap Joys** is set to Off mode.<br>

## MIDI-IN and OUT
Type of MIDI interface can be selected from OSD.<br> There is support for Sequential Inc., Passport/Sentech, DATEL/SIEL/JMS/C-LAB and Namesoft<br>
You can use a [MiSTeryNano MIDI shield](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano/tree/main/board/misteryshield20k/README.md) to interface to a Keyboard.<br>
## RS232 Serial Interface 
The Tang onboard USB-C serial port can be used for communication with the C64 Userport Serial port in [VIC-1011](http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/xother.html) or [UP9600](https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1656) mode.<br>
Terminal programs need the Kernal serial routines therefore select via OSD the CBM Kernal rather than default DolphinDOS.<br> For a first start use UP9600 mode and a Terminal program like [ccgms](https://github.com/mist64/ccgmsterm) and on the PC side [Putty](https://www.putty.org) with 2400 Baud.<br>

OSD selection allows to change in between TANG USB-C port or external HW pin interface.<br>
